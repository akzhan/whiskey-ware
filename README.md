As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want
with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff
is worth it, you can buy me a **whiskey 🥃** in return.

(This license is based on [THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE].
Thanks a lot, Tsuyusato Kitsune and Poul-Henning Kamp ;)

Are you interested? Yeah, let's apply **THE WHISKEY-WARE LICENSE** to your software!

That's easy :)

$ curl -L https://git.io/whiskey-ware > LICENSE.🥃.md
```

Optionally, you can add this badge to your `README.md`: [![WHISKEY-WARE LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-WHISKEY--WARE🥃-452f20.svg)](https://github.com/akzhan/whiskey-ware)

### Notice!

If you are seriously considering to add **"THE WHISKEY-WARE LICENSE"** to your project, you should consider another license like [MIT] and [Apache-2.0] in the same way. Because this license is not approved by [OSI] and [FSF] unfortunately. I cannot atone for any possible damage.

However, this license is not a joke. I'm welcome to your 🥃 present ;)

[Apache-2.0]: https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0

## FAQ

> Is this license GPL compatible?

I think "yes", but sorry, I'm not a lawyer.

> Why did you make this license? Why whiskey 🥃?

I was interested in [THE BEER-WARE LICENSE], but I prefer whiskey! I needed a license like THE BEER-WARE LICENSE for myself. At that time, I wanted to drink whiskey 🥃, so I decided to make THE WHISKEY-WARE LICENSE.

[THE BEER-WARE LICENSE]: https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/

> Anyway, what is whiskey 🥃?

Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. See also this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky).

> It makes sense, but I like spaghetti 🍝... Could I modify this license?

**Of course, okay!** This license itself is based on [THE BEER-WARE LICENSE].

> Thanks! I'll buy you a whiskey 🥃 if we meet some day.

Thanks too! I am looking forward to meeting you ;)
